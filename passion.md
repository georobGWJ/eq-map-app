3-D EQ Displayer

This will have users. They will have locations.

Users will have the option to define a radius that they're interested in for EQ activity.

The app will query the USGS API to get earthquakes above a certain magnitude and store them in a db with a join table to link to the users table.

The app will then display spheres representing the earthquakes in Google maps and or Google earth using Google APIs.
